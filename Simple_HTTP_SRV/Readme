Description
This repository contains the configuration script for setting up a Linux Virtual Machine (VM) on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The provided Bash script automates the initial setup of the VM, including the installation of Apache web server, Splunk, and Docker. It also configures basic firewall rules, disables root login, creates a non-root user with sudo privileges, and enables automatic security updates for the system.

Usage
Create an AWS Linux VM: Launch an AWS EC2 instance and paste the provided user data script in the "User data" field during the instance creation process.

Execute the Script: The script will automatically run upon VM startup, installing and configuring Apache, Splunk, Docker, and applying security best practices.

Accessing Applications: After the script execution and system reboot, Apache, Splunk, and Docker will be accessible based on your AWS instance's public IP address or domain name.

Prerequisites
AWS Account: Ensure you have an active AWS account to create and manage EC2 instances.
Security Groups: Configure AWS security groups to allow incoming traffic on SSH (port 22) and HTTP (port 80) for your VM.
Splunk Package (Optional): If installing Splunk, provide the appropriate download URL for the Splunk package in the script.
Important Notes
Customize the script according to your specific requirements and security policies.
Ensure you keep your system and applications updated to maintain security and performance.
